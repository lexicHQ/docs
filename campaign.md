# Creating Campaign

Create a campaign to send messages to the subscribers of your bot at a future date. It will enable you to qualify and nurture your subscribers based on actions and conditions, offer them discounts, and send the new product notifications.

Here, we will create an on-boarding campaign to re-engage those who have not answered the qualifying question for a product or service.

Click on the "+ New Campaign." 

Here, I want to create a campaign where it will first send out push notification after an hour from the first interaction, and the second one in 24 hours before we consider a lead is lost.

You can create multiple engagements from a simple point-of-entry, as shown below. Here in the following example, I am sending out product information to a potential customer based on her engagement portfolio with the messenger bot:

Now, as we have created a campaign, the next step is to have a user automatically subscribe to it. While in the conversation builder, click on the "Subscribe to Campaign" to add it to the workspace and then select the campaign that you would like to activate.

Once subscribed to a campaign, you would also want to gracefully remove them when it is over and no longer valid. You can do so by using the "UnSubscribe from Campaign" and then select the campaign that you would like a user to unsubscribe from:

Campaigns are essential to increase sales and re-engage subscribers of your messenger bot. Here a notification will be sent out to your qualifying subscribers automatically on a schedule based on profile, interests, and engagement patterns.
